Building strong client relationships is extremely important in Web Development as you are responsible for the online presence of a person, organization, or company. You are designing something that represents that entity, and people have to place a lot of trust into you. The biggest reason a client places trust in a developer is the experience they have had together in the past. If you are just starting out in Web Development, you don't have the past experiences of serving that client, so it is important to start to build trust. The first and biggest way to gain trust and build a relationship is through communication. If you are hard to get a hold of or seem to be not interested in communicating then the client will not want to work with you and possibly see you as unreliable. The second way to build a relationship is to be responsive to feedback given. This can often be difficult as the client may request something that you know is not possible or the best thing to do, so communicating with them in this regard is important. Third, be sure to be honest and never over promise when it comes to your projects or you can very easily leave your client disappointed which can put a strain on the relationship. If you fail to build long term relationships, you will always be chasing new clients which takes up valuable time and is exhausting. Having a good base of faithful clients will likely make it easier for you to succeed.
