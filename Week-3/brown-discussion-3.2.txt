Estimating the time and difficulty of a projects development is extremely important as it will give the project owner a clue as to how much development will cost and when the project can have its initial release. Estimating the time it will take to complete an entire project is just about impossible, so the project is broken down into user stories put down on cards (storycards). Then, those who will be developing the project and the project owner will get together to play Planning Poker. Planning Poker is a game where each of the members of the project team get cards with varying numbers on them (Fibonacci sequence) that correspond to difficulty and the time it will take to complete a task. The business analyst then lays down story cards after which the team members lay down a card they think best describes the difficulty of implementing that user story. If there is a large discrepancy between cards, the team members explain their reasoning. Then the team all lay down their cards again and the new round of cards is averaged and the difficulty is recorded. This game allows for equal input from the team, making the process of estimating the time it will take to complete the project reliant on no one persons experience or knowledge.
