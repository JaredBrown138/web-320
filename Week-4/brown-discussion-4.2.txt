User Personas are an important tool for designers and web developers. They allow us to personify certain groups of people and to boil down the important parts of each group. For example, maybe your site or software has admin or moderator users which help maintain content on the site. You should develop your site (or the admin/mod parts of the site) to best fit the persona of these people. In this case, they are likely power users with significant amount of experience with technology, and they are probably more favorable towards speed than having things look pretty. You should include things like macros and shortcuts, drop any kind of fancy animation or graphics (in order to make the page load faster) as well as keeping a basic work-flow that doesn't change so that the mods can get used to the software and become really efficient. Then you might have personas for your regular users too. You can even further split up the user groups. Perhaps you want to split up regular users into people who have some experience with computers and those that have little experience with users. You may wish to design simple interfaces with large buttons and lots of pictures for those who have little experience. With Persona's you can really dig into all of the details of each user group or subgroup, making this a valuable idea.
