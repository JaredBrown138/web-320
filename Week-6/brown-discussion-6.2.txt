Not being able to meet one another in person for things like meetings is a challenge. Thankfully, with modern technology many of these issues can be resolved. Conference software can allow people to join online virtual meetings with other people or even one on one. Not being able to see the person you are talking to can make things awkward or not so personal so you don't get to build the same kind of relationships, but this software along with a webcam can solve that. Another issue is figuring out deadlines or other dates and letting everyone know these dates. For this problem, we can use shared online calendars that allow us to see what everyone else is up to on a particular date so we can plane a future meeting with them, etc. Team communication apps like slack allow everyone to quickly send messages to ask questions or work through problems. This replaces the conversations you would have if everyone was working in the same office.
